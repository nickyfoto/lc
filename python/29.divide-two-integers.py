#
# Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using
# multiplication, division and mod operator.
# 
# Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
# 
# The integer division should truncate toward zero.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
# Output: 3
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
# Output: -2
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
# The divisor will never be 0.
# Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers
# within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose
# of this problem, assume that your function returns 2^31 − 1 when the division
# result overflows.
