#
# Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than
# x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
# 
# You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the
# two partitions.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
# Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
    def partition(self, head, x):
        pass
# @lc code=end
