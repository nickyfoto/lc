#
# Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains
# the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations
# is the substring of the second string.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
# Output: True
# Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
# Output: False
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The input strings only contain lower case letters.
# The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].

    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        pass
