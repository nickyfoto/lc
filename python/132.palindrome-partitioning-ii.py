# Testcase Example:  '"aab"'
#
# Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a
# palindrome.
# 
# Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:Â "aab"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1
# cut.

class Solution:
    # def minCut(self, s: str) -> int:
    def minCut(self, s):
        pass
# @lc code=end
