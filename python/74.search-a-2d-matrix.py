# Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
# This matrix has the following properties:
# 
# 
# Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
# The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the
# previous row.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# matrix = [
# ⁠ [1,   3,  5,  7],
# ⁠ [10, 11, 16, 20],
# ⁠ [23, 30, 34, 50]
# ]
# target = 3
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# matrix = [
# ⁠ [1,   3,  5,  7],
# ⁠ [10, 11, 16, 20],
# ⁠ [23, 30, 34, 50]
# ]
# target = 13
# Output: false
