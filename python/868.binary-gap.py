#
# Given a positiveÂ integer N, find and return the longest distance between two
# consecutive 1's in the binary representation of N.
# 
# If there aren't two consecutive 1's, return 0.

# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 22
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# 22 in binary is 0b10110.
# In the binary representation of 22, there are three ones, and two consecutive
# pairs of 1's.
# The first consecutive pair of 1's have distance 2.
# The second consecutive pair of 1's have distance 1.
# The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# 5 in binary is 0b101.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: 6
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 
# 6 in binary is 0b110.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: 8
# Output: 0
# Explanation: 
# 8 in binary is 0b1000.
# There aren't any consecutive pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8,
# so we return 0.
#

# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= N <= 10^9
