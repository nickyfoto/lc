#
# Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return
# the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
# Output: "6"
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
# Output: "56088"
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
# Both num1 and num2 contain only digits 0-9.
# Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0
# itself.
# You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to
# integer directly.
