# Testcase Example:  '5\n[1,2,5]'
#
# You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money.
# Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that
# amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of
# coin.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
# 5=5
# 5=2+2+1
# 5=2+1+1+1
# 5=1+1+1+1+1
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# You can assume that
# 
# 
# 0 <= amount <= 5000
# 1 <= coin <= 5000
# the number of coins is less than 500
# the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
# 
# 
#

class Solution:
    # def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
    def change(self, amount, coins):
        dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for c in coins:
            for x in range(c, amount + 1):
                dp[x] += dp[x - c]
        return dp[amount]
