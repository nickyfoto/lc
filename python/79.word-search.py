# Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
# 
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where
# "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same
# letter cell may not be used more than once.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# board =
# [
# ⁠ ['A','B','C','E'],
# ⁠ ['S','F','C','S'],
# ⁠ ['A','D','E','E']
# ]
# 
# Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
# Given word = "SEE", return true.
# Given word = "ABCB", return false.
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
class Solution:
    # def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
    def exist(self, board, word):
        pass
# @lc code=end
