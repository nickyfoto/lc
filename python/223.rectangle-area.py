# Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.
# 
# Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as
# shown in the figure.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
# Output: 45
# 
# Note:
# 
# Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.
#
